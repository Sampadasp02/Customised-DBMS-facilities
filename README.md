# Customised-Database-Management-System
This project provides the emulation of all the facilities and functionalities provided by the DBMS. For emulation purpose we create  parser to parse the SQL queries. Each query gets handled explicitly with all constraints and aggregate functions.  We provide our own customised shell to interact with the CDBMS.
